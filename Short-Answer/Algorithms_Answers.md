#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - as the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grow at the same rate. when n = 1, the loop iterates 1 time, when n = 2, the loop iterates 2 times, when n = 3, the loop iterates 3 times, etc. etc.

b) 
the outer loop is O(n) because as the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used grows at the same rate. if n = 1, the outer loop iterates 1 time, if n = 2, the outer loop iterates 2 times, etc. 

The second or inner loop is O(log n) because as the size of n increases, the runtime or space used wil grow at a slightly slower rate. 

However, both loops combined is polynomial O(n^c) because as the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grow at a faster rate. when n = 3, outer loop executes 3 times and inner loop executes 6 times, when n = 5, outer loop executes 5 times and inner loop executes 15 times.

c) Î˜(n) - as the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grow at the same rate. if bunnies = 10, the function executes 10 times before reaching base case and if bunnies = 5, the function  is executed 5 times before reaching base case, etc.
